This is the README file for the Dystopia 1.2 codebase.

Please read all the .txt files located in this folder, most of
them contain information which is vital or useful.

** The DNS lookup in new_descriptor() is handled by a detached pthread,
   allowing new connections to be accepted without blocking on DNS resolution.
   The lookup_status system (STATUS_LOOKUP, STATUS_DONE, STATUS_WAIT,
   STATUS_CLOSED) prevents race conditions when a connection is closed while
   a DNS lookup thread is still running.

** Theres a major lack in help files, it would be nice if someone would take
   the time to figure out exactly which help files are missing, and either
   write some of them or just report them to me.

** zlib dependency (required for MCCP compression):
   - Linux: If you get a compile error referring to -lz, install the zlib
     development package (e.g., apt install zlib1g-dev on Debian/Ubuntu).
   - Windows: zlib is bundled in game/lib/win64/ - no additional installation
     needed.
