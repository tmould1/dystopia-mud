#x245Welcome to Dystopia!#n

New players: Type '#Rhelp tutorial#n' for a quick start guide.
Returning players: Type '#Rhelp dystopiaplus#n' for dystopia-specific features.

Please read the following help files:
  RULES, POLICY, FORGE, BRIEF, NEWBIE, CLASS and PROTOCOLS

Important: Read help on WHO, PARADOX and PARADOXSTATS

Thanks, enjoy the game!

~

1 CHANGES~
These are the changes done to the stock Dystopia 1.2 code

* Nothing yet.

~

1 RULES~
1) Be cool.

~

-1 ALIAS~
The alias system.

You are allowed to have 30 aliases. The following commands can be used.

alias       - Creates a new alias.
removealias - Removes an old alias you don't want.
showalias   - Shows all aliases that you have made.

examples :

* alias cc c 'dispel magic'

By typing cc <target>, the player now casts dispel magic on that target.
To remove this alias, a player would simply type 'removealias cc'.

Feel free to experiment with aliases.

~

1 BULLY~
It's not considered nice to harrash players that are much weaker than yourself.
It is quite okay to mort and tie someone weaker than yourself if they talked trash,
killed your mobs or killed one of your friends, but it is not okay to constantly
harrash players that are weaker than yourself simply because you feel like it.

Should a player act like a real bully, a special bullyflag will be added to that
player. Anyone with a bullyflag will show as a bully on who and have a harder time
dodging and parrying. The bully flag will be removed when that player has learned
to act like a normal person.

(Whether a player is a bully or not is decided at the discression of the immortals,
trying to get the immortals to set the bully flag on someone will result
in the bully flag being set on yourself)

We hope never to actually set the bully flag on anyone, this is afterall a playerkilling
mud, and people should expect to be morted, tied and killed; but should harrashment be
taken to the extreme by a player, we will set the flag on the offending player.

~

1 WHO~

Typing who will show a list of the players online that you can see, using the following style :

#p  Title#n      #y(#Gx.xx#y)#n     #0<<#RCLASS#0>>#n         PlayerName

* The Title is based on the players size, and who is sorted somewhat after this.
  The lowest title is 'Wannabe' and they cannot kill nor be killed by other players.
  If your a wannabe and want to pk, then you need to grow in size first, this is
  done by either training more hitpoints or training more skills (weapons, stances, etc).

* The (x.xx) is the pkratio of that player, and the colors around the numbers shows
  whether you can kill that player and if she/he can kill you, heres the deal :

  if the #R()#n's are red, that means you can #Gboth#n kill eachother.
  if the #0()#n's are black, that means that the player can #Gkill you#n, but you can't kill him/her.
  if the #y()#n's are yellow, that means you can #Gkill them#n, but they can't kill you.
  if the #L()#n's are blue, #Gneither#n of you can kill eachother.

* The Class and PlayerName are obvious.

Enjoy!

~

-1 RAGNAROK~
#0RAGNAROK MODE#n

When time comes, the world will sunder and the gods will walk the earth
spreading havoc and destruction, this is a time of slaughter, and no one
will be safe, this is the age of Ragnarok.

Using the command 'mudstat' you'll be able to tell if ragnarok is on,
if it's not, you'll just get the normal mudstat screen.

Doing ragnarok the following changes are in effect :

* There are no safe rooms.
* Everyone has scry, and it bypasses all shields.
* You can decap anyone, anywhere. (no paradox).
* Heads will vanish faster.
* Players will auto train avatar and get a restore.
* Upgrades can only fight other upgrades.
* You do not lose ANYTHING if capped during ragnarok.
* Base classes can only fight other base classes.
* You are safe for 3 ticks after training avatar. (to rewear)

player can turn on ragarok buy pooling qps toward it, using
the ragnarok command. ie. 'ragnarok 200' will add 200 qps
to the ragnarok pool (currently 3000 qps is needed to turn
on ragnarok). mudstat will show how many qps is still needed,
and ragnarok cannot be turned on for two hours after it has
last been on.

Ragnarok lasts 15 minutes.

Enjoy
~

1 SETLOGIN SETLOGOUT SETAVATAR SETTIE SETDECAP~
With these commands you can set the message other players gets when you enter
or leave the game, as well as train avatar. Each time you set this message,
you must pay 1000 qps.

There are certain rules that must be followed, they are rather simple though, so
you shouldn't have any trouble following them.

* No profanities in the message.
* No referring to any of the immortals or other players besides the possibly victim.
* I'll remove your ability to change your messages if you abuse this in any way.

The syntax is easy, heres a few examples :

setlogin $n draws his scimitars and prepares for battle as he enters Dystopia.
settie $n grins in triumph as $e ties up $N.

Heres the syntax :

  $n  This is your name.
  $N  This is the name of the possible victim.
  $e  Results in he/she depending on your sex.
  $E  Results in he/she depending on the victims sex.
  $m  Results in him/her depending on your sex.
  $M  Results in him/her depending on the victims sex.
  $s  Results in his/her depending on your sex.
  $S  Results in his/her depending on the victims sex.

~

1 MCCP MCCP2~
MCCP (MUD Client Compression Protocol) compresses data sent between the
server and your client. Benefits include:

1. Lower bandwidth usage by the mud.
2. Faster response times - large outputs (like combat spam) arrive quicker.

MCCP is transparent to the user - it automatically enables itself when
supported by both the server and client. Use the #yprotocols#n command to
check if MCCP is active on your connection.

#yVersions:#n
  MCCP v1 - Original compression protocol
  MCCP v2 - Improved protocol, preferred by modern clients

#yExperience Bonus:#n
  MCCP v1: #G+25%#n exp bonus
  MCCP v2: #G+100%#n exp bonus (4x the v1 bonus!)

Most modern MUD clients support MCCP v2, including:
  * Mudlet
  * MUSHclient
  * zMUD/CMUD
  * TinTin++
  * BlowTorch (Android)

~

1 PROTOCOLS~
#yProtocols Command#n

The #yprotocols#n command displays your current protocol support status. It shows
which protocols are active between your client and the server.

#ySyntax:#n protocols

#ySupported Protocols:#n
  #GMCCP#n  - MUD Client Compression Protocol (see #yhelp mccp#n)
  #GGMCP#n  - Generic MUD Communication Protocol (see #yhelp gmcp#n)
  #GMXP#n   - MUD eXtension Protocol (see #yhelp mxp#n)
  #GMSSP#n  - MUD Server Status Protocol (see #yhelp mssp#n)

Protocol negotiation happens automatically when you connect. If your client
supports a protocol, it will be enabled without any action needed from you.

~

1 GMCP~
#yGMCP - Generic MUD Communication Protocol#n

GMCP provides structured data communication between the server and client,
enabling advanced client features like health bars, maps, and room info.

#yFeatures:#n
  * Real-time character vitals (HP, Mana, Move)
  * Room information (name, exits, area)
  * Character status updates
  * Affects/buffs display

#ySupported Packages:#n
  Char.Vitals    - Health, mana, movement stats
  Char.Status    - Character name, class, level info
  Room.Info      - Current room details and exits

GMCP data is invisible to the player but enables your client to display
graphical gauges, mini-maps, and other enhanced interface elements.

#yCompatible Clients:#n Mudlet, CMUD, MUSHclient (with plugin)

Use the #yprotocols#n command to check if GMCP is active.

~

1 MXP~
#yMXP - MUD eXtension Protocol#n

MXP enables rich text features in compatible clients, including clickable
links, popup menus, and enhanced text formatting.

#yFeatures:#n
  * Clickable commands and links
  * Custom colors and formatting
  * Entity definitions for special characters
  * Secure and open line modes

MXP works transparently - when enabled, certain game text may become
clickable or show enhanced formatting in your client.

#yCompatible Clients:#n Mudlet, MUSHclient, zMUD/CMUD

Use the #yprotocols#n command to check if MXP is active.

~

1 MSSP~
#yMSSP - MUD Server Status Protocol#n

MSSP provides server information to MUD listing sites and crawlers. This
protocol helps players discover the MUD through directory websites.

#yInformation Provided:#n
  * Server name and codebase
  * Player count and uptime
  * Gameplay features
  * Connection details

MSSP operates automatically and requires no player interaction. It simply
allows the server to report its status to interested listing services.

#yListing Sites:#n MUD listings like mudstats.com and topmudsites.com use
MSSP to automatically gather server information.

Use the #yprotocols#n command to check if MSSP is active.

~

1 BRIEF4 BRIEF3 BRIEF2 BRIEF1~

With the command brief1, brief2, brief3 and brief4, you can toggle how much you'll
recieve from looking and combat.

brief1 -> Information when you look toggled between short/long.
brief2 -> Toggle shields, misses and weapon burn/freeze in combat.
brief3 -> Toggle dodge/parry messages in combat.
brief4 -> Toggle message on exp modifiers, discipline points and class points.

~

-1 NEWBIE~
#RThe Newbie Helper#n

#R*#n First kill some mobs in the newbie arena (located south of where you start, that's
  up and south from recall), when you have 2K hps, you can train avatar and use
  the selfclass command to gain a class.
#R*#n After getting a class, you should get a little buffer from killing mobs in newbie
  arena, then move on to either Elemental Canyon or The Black Dragons Lair.
  The Lair can be found 2 south, 6 east, 2 south and down from recall.
#R*#n During the first 4 hours of play you cannot be attacked by other players, and should
  use this time to get stronger, remember to get all your class powers, read the
  help file on your class and do the best you can.
#R*#n There are some help files you might want to read, since they'll help you alot.
  The list : BRIEF, EXP, MCCP, CHANGES, RULES and POLICY, they each contain knowledge
  that is useful for new players to this mud (not just newbies).
#R*#n Remember the following :
  #R*#n The higher your unarmed ability is, the less you will get hit by monsters.
  #R*#n Treat others with the same respect you would want them to show you, it will
    help you get along alot easier (Remember be nice while your small, you can always be mean later)
  #R*#n If you don't know how a thing is done, try seeing if their is a help file on the
    subject, if there isn't we could use one, and your welcome to write it and mail it the staff.

Good luck, and all that :)

~

1 MULTIPLAYING PLAYERSHARING~
Multiplaying and playersharing is strictly forbidden, the rules
are as this (and don't try and find loopholes, I'll just wipe you).

* No more than 1 char can connect via 1 ip, so local networks
  don't work, unless you have more than one ip available.
* Going linkdead to trade items from one char to another is not
  allowed, it still counts as multiplaying.
* Having more than one person controlling a character on the mud
  is called playersharing and it not allowed.
* No transfering of items and/or qps from one char to another
  that you own, read HELP RULES on how I deal with people who
  think they found a loophole.
* If an immortal tells you to stop multiplaying, you will stop
  instantly, there will only be given one warning, next time
  ANYONE multiplays from that ip, ALL chars from that ip will
  be deleted.

Don't argue, if an imm tells you that your multiplaying, then
you are. We don't give a shit if it's your mother that controls
the other character.

~

1 POLICY~

#R* #nNo spamming any channels.
#R* #nSpellbotting is allowed OUTSIDE of midgaard.
#R* #nBeing kind to newbies means more pk action.
#R* #nIf you find some way to get around something that is not normal possibly
  without breaking the rules, you can consider it against TOS.
  - Use your brain, if safeguards were made to prevent players to do certain
    things, and you find a way around it, it's a bug, report it.

#R** #nIf you don't like any or all of these rules or policies leave this site.

#R** #nThe penalty for breaking the rules is decided by the immortal that
   punishes you.

~

1 PARADOX~
When a player decaps someone not in their range, they get paradox'ed,
which means they end up morted in midgaard, which really isn't healthy.
A player getting paradox'ed will also lose 10% of their MAX hps.

The range works in this way :

Each player has a certain powerscore assigned to them, and this score will
go up (or down) as this player gets more powerful, these are the things that
affect how powerful you are in regard to the powerscore :

* How many hitpoints you have (max hps, not current).
* If you have mastery or not.
* How many superstances you have (0 to 5).
* Whether your an upgrade or not.
* A small change for the amount of rune a player may have.
* Spell affects like trains or blesses should will not affect this score.

If you decap someone which are not within your range, you get a paradoxcounter,
should you ever get 3 of these counters you will be struck by paradox. You can
only get rid of counters by decapping players within your range.

Also read PARADOXSTATS.

~

1 PARADOXSTATS~
Taking a base in hps, the paradoxrange looks at a number calculated from the following.

* Each skill mastered (weapons, stances, spells) gives a small modifier,
  a fully mastered player get's a 10K total modifier.
* Superstances counts as 5K hps a piece. (25K hps when you have ss5).

If a player doesn't have more than 15K now, we don't add anything else.
  #G#y(actually a player with less than 15K can't be killed nor kill#G)#n
But if the player has more than 15K we take a look at the following.

* Possibly Rune eq counts as 1K hps a piece for a max of 14 (yes, 14K).
* Being an upgrade will modify this number in a special way :)
* Each extra level beyond level 1 as upgrade counts as an extra 12K hps.

We then compare the number of the attacker and the defender, deciding
whether the attacker is allowed to decap or not.

And no, I will not explain this any better, if you don't understand, then
you'll just have to live with not understanding.

~
-1 STORY~
It is a time of great magic.  Powerful immortals battle across the world
for domination, slaying and pillaging at will.  Only the greatest can 
survive...are you one of them?
~

1 PKPOWERS~
 
Pkpowers are special powers that becomes available to players as
they rise in pkscore. To see your pkscore type 'top' this will
not only show you your own score, but also show the top10 of
best players (in regard to pkscore).

The pkscore is based on your pk record (kills and deaths), and
you gain a power for each 500 points you have. You can type
'pkpower' to gain a list of powers you can use.

pkscore   power
-----------------
  500    Sanctum         -  a healing power.
 1000    Eaglesight      -  a scrying power.
 1500    Awereness       -  (auto).
 2000    Lifesense       -  a readaura power.
 2500    Supreme attack  -  (auto).
 3000    Call to Arms    -  summons help.
 3500    Objectscry      -  scry through items.
 4000    Ironmind	 -  reverse damage.
 4500    Crystalsight    -  superior sight for a while.
 5000    Silverpath      -  powerful portal.

~

1 MASTERY~

When you have grandmasterd all your stances, spells and weapons,
you can use the mastery command to gain a mastery item, which
is a piece of classeq that's better than your normal classeq.

syntax : mastery

NOTE : If you gemstone your mastery item, talk with a dev.
[IDEA] - Allow mastery to accept your old mastery item as an
argument to replace it, if you have done something you regret.

0 QUESTKEY~
From now on ill put a #yQuest#RKey#n in game every day.
Keep them they are very valueable.

Do not keep them in containers, store chars, or in other ways keep them from other
players if they cap you!!

If i find you breaking ANY of those rules ill punish you.

1  Questkey      1000qp
7  Questkey      1 generation
15 Questkey      1 artifact affect on a pice of your eq

Dracknuur.
~

0 ARENA~

The rules in the arena are simple :

* No use of 'safe powers', meaning no going invis, objectform, shadowplane
  or any other power that leaves you safe from attacks.

To beat another player, you must tie them with the 'tie <players>' command,
and that player will be removed from the arena and given a restore.

Last man (or woman) standing in the arena will be the winner.

The arena opens every 2 hours for normal battles, all the normal
rules apply, and the winner gets a small prize. Some of these battles
will be for base classes alone. (you can type timer to see when the next
arena will be).

Currently we are working on some nifty arena commands, and so far we have
made these commands :

* Arenastats - Shows the stats on the people in the arena.
* Arenajoin  - Let's you join the arena when it opens (happens once in a while).
* Resign     - Give up, you'll leave the arena and get an arena loss.

~

0 GENERATION GENSTEAL~

All new chars start at generation 6, and can improve their
generation by stealing generation from other chars with same
or better (lower) generation than them self.

syntax : gensteal <victim>

victim must be morted.

Generation gives a damcap bonus.

At generation 2 your max weaponskill goes up by 10%.
At generation 1 your max weaponskill goes up by 20%.

0 CASTLE~
#CYes you are right, you got your self a new castle!.#n

You say#y 'So whats new?'#n
Dracknuur says#y 'Shut up and read the note!'#n

1. Every castle got a healer/guard now, pure stock!
2. more rooms addet.
3. A entrance (no more safe hugging in castles)...:)

Now its up to you, to make the castle as you want it.
I want a description for every room in the castle, a long
and a short.

The Temple Square #R<----#CThis is a short description#n
[Exits: north east south west up]
You are standing on the temple square.  Huge marble steps lead up to the #R<----#Cthis is a long#n
temple gate.  The entrance to the Clerics Guild is to the west, and the old
Grunting Boar Inn, is to the east.  Just south of here you see the market
square, the center of Midgaard.
     A small white fountain gushes forth here.

I want to know the name of your healer and guard (short and long description agin)
And the info you guard shall shout when your castle is under attack.

when you have done all this mail me on mayhaven@worldonline.dk and ill fill it in.
colors in the castle you just put in like you do in the game, if i find you not
interested in making your castle, ill just find another king.

the guard is weak now, we are thinking of making a way to make him stronger, 
but that is future.....now make your descriptions and mail me.

I know some of you spend qp on healer/guards before this...(you will be reimbet)

#CFrom now off when there is a change on the mud, it will be on help changes!...#n

1 KINGDOMS~
Fill out the details on your kingdoms here :)

commands :

kstat       - lists the special stats for your own kingdom
kset        - changes the kingdom settings (king and immortals only)
kinduct     - inducts kingdom members (general and king only)
koutcast    - outcasts kingdom members (general and king only)
kingdoms    - lists all kingdoms and their stats/reqs
ktalk       - kingdom channel
wantkingdom - toggles the ability to be inducted on/off
kingset     - immortal command to set players kingdom

The kingdom code is just a coresystem, and doesn't contain much besides
the basic functionality of a kingdom. The immortals of the mud should
create the kind of kingdom they want.

~

0 SUPERSTANCES~

When you have grandmastered all you normal stances, you can create your
own stances with the setstance command. The setstance command will tell
you how to create a new stance, and how much xp it costs; but beware,
once you have finished your superstance, your stuck with it forever.
Also notice that you won't get any extra powers by chosing the same
power several times, even if you choose both lesser and greater version,
it's just a waste of xp.

Enjoy.

0 UPGRADE~
Upgrading is a way to choose among some of the more powerful classes;
to upgrade you need to max your char first, then you can choose to
exchange that char for a new char of that class's upgrade class...

#RThe reqs for upgrading is #0:#n
50K hp, 35K mana, 35K move, 40K Questpoints and generation 1.

For each 100 pkscore you have less than 1000, you must pay an extra
3K in hp/move/mana to upgrade, you cannot pay more than 30K extra.

Having more than 1000 pkscore will not reduce the cost for upgrading.

When you upgrade you get set to 5K across and loose ALL class powers,
then you get your new class. You've been warned, so don't whine when
you lose all your old powers, that's just life.

It is possibly for an upgrade to improve their powers even
more, read HELP UPGRADE2 to check out the facts.

~

1 UPGRADE2~
When a player have upgrade to his new class, he/she can upgrade
again and again, though instead of losing his or her old class and
gaining a new one, they keep their class and powers, but gets set
to 5K across. In return for this, they gain additional damcap/dodge/
parry/attacks/etc.

0 CLAIM CALL GIFT LOCATE~
Syntax: claim <object>
Syntax: call <object>
Syntax: call all
Syntax: gift <object> <player>
Syntax: locate

By claiming an object (which costs 500 exp), that object becomes your 
personal property.  Using the 'locate' command you can find what items 
currently belong to you and where they are in the mud.  If you are not 
carrying the item, you can get it back by calling it with the 'call' 
command.  You can change the ownership of your own items by use of the 
'gift' command.

It should be noted that relics CANNOT be gifted.

~



0 DECAPITATE~
Do this to another avatar when they are mortally wounded, and you will 
suck out some of their lifeforce ( 1/4th of their exp), making them 
mortal again.  You may also loot their corpse, of course, and if you are 
hungry you can even crack the skull and eat their brains ;)
Decapitation alone is not enough to completely destroy another avatar 
however, for their head will retain their remaining lifeforce.  To truely 
kill them, you must crack open their head and eat (or in some other way 
destroy) their brain.

Syntax: decap <victim>
~



0 CRACK~
While holding a head in either your left or right hand, typing 'crack' 
will crack the head open, spilling the brains out onto the floor.
~



0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with you.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is half of your 
current amount, so it's a good idea not to hoard exp.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
~



0 ESCAPE~
This command allows you to transport to the temple of midgaard when 
mortally wounded.  Unfortunately, it also reduces both your mana and move 
to 0, and informs everyone else on the mud that you are lying defenseless 
at recall...so be careful how you use it.
~



0 MOUNT DISMOUNT~
Syntax: mount <creature>
Syntax: dismount

This allows the character to mount the specified creature.  Only 
creatures such as horses and the like may be mounted, and they will aid 
their rider in combat.

For information on the MOUNT spell, type 'help mountspell'.
~



0 QUESTS~
Quest Makers (and occasionally higher levels) can set quests for one or 
more players to participate in.  The rewards for such quests can be in 
the form of specially modified equipment.  A number of quest points-worth 
will be allocated depending on the difficulty of the quest, using the 
following guidelines for point costs (QP's = Quest Points):

Stats (Str/Dex/Int/Wis/Con): 20 QP's per +1, max allowed is +3 per stat.
Hp/Mana/Move: 5 QP per +1, max allowed is +25 on each.
Hitroll/Damroll: 30 QP's per +1, max allowed is +5 on each.
Ac: 10 QP's per -1, max allowed is -25.

Once a certain affect (str, hitroll, ac, etc) is selected, it cannot be 
chosen again for that item even if you didn't select the maximum allowed 
amount.  Choosing to have penalties on an item will not decrease its 
cost, although some Quest Makers may allow extra points if you select a 
few disadvantages on the item.

For more information, type 'quest'.
~



0 QUEST TOKEN~
Syntax: quest <field> <value>
Syntax: token <value>

QUEST will allow you to spend any quest points you might have.  For a 
list of the cost (in quest points), type 'quest'.

TOKEN will allow you to create a quest token, with the value of the token 
set to the value specified.  The tokens value must be within 1 and 50, 
and it cannot be greater than the number of quest points you currently 
have.

For information on the QUEST spell, type 'help questspell'.
~



0 QUESTCARD COMPLETE RECHARGE~
Syntax: complete card
Syntax: complete card <object>
Syntax: recharge card machine

A quest card requires 4 objects to complete.  To find out what 4 objects 
you need, type 'complete card'.  When you find these items, you should 
type 'complete card <object>'.  Once you have completed all 4 items on 
the card you will be told that you have completed the card.  Then you 
should go and find the dark crypt, where there is a machine, and type 
'recharge card machine'.  You will receive a quest token reward, which 
you should eat, and the card will be recharged with 4 new items to find.

HINT:  Vallandar's tomb can be found by going 2 south, 7 east, 2 north 
from recall.  Once you have found that area, you should look for the 
guardian and solve his riddle, enter the portal he creates, and you'll be 
in the dark crypt.
~



0 QUEST-TYPES~
The following are a few examples of quest types:
* Find the object/s.  Examples: Find 5 different coloured potions, Find a 
  pitch black longsword that flames brightly, Find a dragon dagger, belt 
  and bracer, etc.
* Kill the mob/s.  These can be hunt down and kill, or simple placing the 
  player in the same room as the mob/s.  Can also be combined with finding 
  objects - Example: Find and kill two different dragons and bring me 
  their claws.
* Solve a puzzle.  For example find a certain room, solve a riddle in an 
  area, or successfully get out of a maze.  These are particularly good 
  when several players of different ability are competing in the quest.
* Duel: A one-on-one fight pitting either a player against a mob, or 
  (more usually) a player against another player.  The conditions will be 
  decided beforehand, and can include any conditions that both sides 
  agree on.  Example: No sanctuary, no potions (or maybe a limited number),
  no spells, no weapons, or whatever.
* Skirmishes: Like a duel, but involves several players on either side.  
  Although the sides don't have to be equal in number, it is generally a 
  good idea to make sure they are roughly equal in power.
* There are also several more obscure quests that can be run - for 
  example you could require that the player brings you 3 small green 
  eggs, then load mob 30005 into the players room.  Another battle might 
  involve no melee - all combat must be with missile weapons.
~



0 EXPERIENCE XP~
#n #n
Experience is gained by killing mobs, the amount of experience
gained through a kill depends on the level of the mob being killed.
There are also different modifiers like happy hour and newbie exp.

The exp modifiers are as listed :

* Newbie hours (The first 4 hours) : gives 200 % extra exp.
* Happy (Immortals can set this)   : gives 100 % extra exp.
* Pkscore (only positive value)    : gives   1 % for each 50 pkscore.
* Tithe (worshippers only)         : gives  -5 % exp (that's less)
* Mccp   (read Help mccp)          : gives  25 % extra exp.
* Alignment (explained below)      : gives +/- 25% extra exp.

#GAlignment explaned#n
If your kill a mob of the opposite alignment as yourself, fx. if your
aligned good and you kill an evil mob, you gain 25% extra exp from
the kill. BUT if your the same alignment as the mob you get 25% LESS
exp from killing that mob.

#GGuidelines about modifiers#n
* DO NOT ask immortals to turn on Happy Hour!
* Use #ymccp#n to get the 25% extra exp, it helps the mud run smother.
    #RYou can use mccp with #yANY#R mudclient out there, please#n
    #Rread the help file on #ymcclient#R if your normal mudclient doesn't#n
    #Rsupport mccp by itself. Mcclient is NOT a client, it simply helps#n
    #Ryour normal client so it can use the mccp protocol.#n
* If you for some reason don't get a certain modifier even though your sure
  that you should get it, please recheck everything, perhaps you shouldn't
  get it afterall.

This shows the target player's skill with the weapon they are currently 
wielding and the stance they are in (if it's a specialized stance).

Weapon skill				 Stance skill

 1) Totally unskilled.			 1) Totally unskilled.
 2) Slightly skilled.			 2) An apprentice.

slightly more skilled than another master, and so on.
~

7 PFILE~
Jope is an online pfile editor, which makes it possibly to edit
pfiles without having shell access. Which parts of a pfile that
can be editted depends on the immortals level, and it's quite
easy to change these settings (and add more editable data) in
the file 'jope.c'.

syntax : pfile <players FULL name>

Please don't use this command on a player that is already online.

~

0 SPELL SPELLS~
Syntax: spells | spell <colour>

This shows your spell casting ability with the various types of magic.

1) Untrained.				 6) An adept.
2) An apprentice.			 7) A mage.
3) A student.				 8) A warlock.
4) A scholar.				 9) A master wizard.
5) A magus.				10) A grand sorcerer.

Note that these are only rough estimates; one master wizard might well be 
slightly more skilled than another master wizard, and so on.
~



0 GODLESS~
By typing this, you will no longer be affected by most god commands, 
including restore, force, slay, mset, transfer, deny, freeze, etc.  You 
can toggle your godless flag on and off at will, and everyone in the mud 
is informed each time you do this.
~



0 HOME~
To set your recall point, enter the desired room and type 'home here'.  
From that point on you will recall to that point rather than the Temple 
of Midgaard (although you still go to the Templar Altar if you die).

A home cannot be a safe room.
~



0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.


f these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~



0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south

yntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your magical ability increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your inventory.
~

0 AC 'ARMOR CLASS' 'ARMOUR CLASS'~
Armor Class (AC) represents how well protected you are from physical attacks.
Lower AC values provide better protection - the more negative, the better.

Your AC is determined by:
  - Equipment worn (armor, shields, magical items)
  - Magical effects and spells
  - Class abilities and powers

AC affects how often enemies hit you and how much damage you take.
You can see your current AC in your SCORE.

See also: EQUIPMENT, COMPARE, SCORE
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~

0 BACKSTAB BERSERK BS DISARM KICK PUNCH KILL~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: berserk
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: punch    <character>
Syntax: kill     <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

BERSERK will make you strike out at every creature in the room.  It will 
hit players as well as mobiles, so it's a good idea not to use this skill 
while you are grouped.
DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.
PUNCH will inflict a small amount of damage, and stun your opponent for a 
short period of time.  It also has a chance of breaking your opponents 
nose or jaw.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, KICK or PUNCH successfully, you must practice
the appropriate skill.
~

0 FASTDRAW~

FASTDRAW is automatic, if you have it.  If another player attacks you 
while you have any sheathed weapons, you will draw them out with 
lightning speed and strike your opponent before they are able to land any 
blows on you.  If you have any items in your hands at the time, you will 
throw them aside before drawing your weapons.
~

0 ANSI COLOUR~
Syntax: ansi

This will show things in colour.  Spells will appear in their appropriate 
colour, and important messages will be highlighted.  Your exp (or opponents
condition if you're fighting), hp, mana and move are shown in scaled colour.
Scaled colour is represented as follows:

New scale.

#7White = Under 0%
#gDark Green = 0%
#n(In Between)
#pPink
#PMagenta
#oBrown
#rDark Red
#3Yellow
#u-------#n
#2Light Green = 100%+#n

Ansi colour can be toggled on and off with the 'ansi' or 'config' commands.
~

0 STANCE~
Syntax: combat <style>

In combat, the stance of the fighter plays a very important role; you 
can't just stand there and exchange blow for blow unless you are very 
confident of your ability.  Each fighting stance has advantages and 
disadvantages, the basic outline of which follows:
VIPER: A very fast and aggressive style of combat, concentrating on 
striking your opponent before they have the chance to avoid or block you.
CRANE: A wide, sweeping style of combat, which concentrates on a very 
strong blocking defence.
CRAB: A low, defensive fighting stance which uses agile footwork and 
rolling with attacks in order to reduce your injuries.
MONGOOSE: A light-footed stance, which relies on leaps and acrobatics to 
ensure that by the time your opponent makes their attack, you've moved 
out of the way.
BULL: A low aggressive stance which concentrates purely on physical power.

See also help on 'advancedstance' and 'stancetable'.
~

0 ADVANCEDSTANCE~
Syntax: combat <style>

Advanced stances can be learned after you have become a grand master in 
two normal stances.  These stances are much better than the others.
MANTIS: Requires CRANE and VIPER before it can be learned.  This stance 
combines a very strong defence with lightning fast counter attacks.
DRAGON: Requires BULL and CRAB before it can be learned.  This stance 
uses very powerful attacks, as well as protecting the fighter from injury.
TIGER: Requires BULL and VIPER before it can be learned.  Probably the 
most aggressive of all the stances, this style utilizes very powerful and
lightning fast attacks.
MONKEY: Requires CRANE and MONGOOSE before it can be learned.  The only 
affect of this stance is to completely nullify the advantages of your 
opponents stance.
SWALLOW: Requires MONGOOSE and CRAB before it can be learned.  This is 
the most defensive of all the stances, combining agile dodges with the 
ability to 'roll' with an attack, helping prevent injury.

See also help on 'stance' and 'stancetable'.
~

0 STANCETABLE~

The following table is a rough comparison of stances, giving a value 
between 10 and -10, where the higher the number the better your chance of 
victory.  Cross-reference your stance from the left with your opponents 
stance from along the top.  Please remember these are only rough 
estimates, and may not be completely accurate...

0 FIGHT STYLE FIGHTSTYLE~
Syntax: fightstyle <number> <style>

This is used for unarmed combat, and it allows the fighter to decide on 
their style of unarmed attack.  Many different types of attack are 
possible, each with different advantages and disadvantages.  Your first 
attack in combat always uses the first number slot.  If you have a second 
attack, this will draw a fighting technique from slots 1 to 4.  If you 
have a third attack, it will draw a fighting technique from slots 5 to 
8.  Any other attacks are randomly drawn from any of slots 1 to 8.  If 
the slot is blank (0) then the attack is a standard unarmed attack.
~

0 HURL~
Syntax: hurl <name>
Syntax: hurl <name> <direction>

This ability allows you to hurl the target into walls, through exits, or 
through doors.  Hurling someone through an exit does a little damage.  
Hurling them into walls does twice as much, and hurling them through 
doors does three times as much.  If you don't specify a direction to hurl 
the target, it will be random (north, south, east or west).  You cannot 
hurl someone who is already injured.
~

0 SCAN SPY THROW~
Syntax: scan
Syntax: spy   <direction>
Syntax: throw <direction> <target>

SCAN allows you to see all the mobs/players within 1 room of you.

SPY allows you to see all the mobs/players within 3 rooms in a specified 
direction.

THROW allows you to hurl an object you are holding (in your right hand, 
or if that's empty left hand) to a target mob/player in a specified 
direction.  The object can be throw up to 3 rooms.  If it fails to reach 
the target by that time it will land on the floor.

For information on the SCAN spell, type 'help scanspell'.
~

0 FLEE RESCUE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.

0 EXAMINE LOOK~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>

~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.

For info on the sleep spell, type: 'help sleepspell'.
~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

Syntax: note show
Syntax: note post
Syntax: note remove  <number>

NOTE LIST lists notes which you can read.  NOTE READ reads one or all notes.

NOTE SUBJECT sets the subject line of a new note.  NOTE TO sets the list of
recipients.  The recipient ALL means all players, and the recipient IMMORTAL
means all immortals.  Use NOTE + to write message lines onto the note, one line
at a time.  NOTE SHOW shows your note in progress; NOTE CLEAR starts over.

NOTE POST posts your note for reading.  Posting is not automatic.

NOTE REMOVE removes the entire note if you are the sender, or just removes you
from the to-list if you are a recipient.

inventory.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not

to use it properly.

inventory.
~

~

0 PROMPT CPROMPT~

This command allows you to configure your prompt.  The PROMPT command 
will set your standard prompt.  You also have the option of having a 
combat prompt, CPROMPT, which will appear while fighting.  If no cprompt 
is defined, the standard prompt will be used for both conditions.
The following options are available:

To switch your prompt on and off, use 'prompt on' and 'prompt off'.
For some examples, type 'help prompts'.
~

0 PROMPTS~

There are many possible prompts, and everyone will have their own 
favoured setups.  However, to get you going, here are some examples:

Original normal prompt: [%x exp] <%h/%Hhp %m/%Mm %v/%Vmv>
Original combat prompt: [%f] <%h/%Hhp %m/%Mm %v/%Vmv>
Simple prompt: [%hH/%mM/%vV]
Vampire prompt: [%B Blood] <%hhp %mm %vmv>
Werewolf prompt: [%R Rage] <%hhp %mm %vmv>
Combat prompt: [%N:%F/%n:%f]
Stat prompt: [%xX] [+%pHIT/+%PDAM] [%cAC] [%hH/%mM/%vV]

Remember, you can switch between the default prompts and your customised
prompts with 'prompt on' and 'prompt off'.  Doing this will not destroy 
your customised prompts.
~

0 PRIMAL~

Primal energy is the ultimate form of energy in the multiverse, the one 
from which all other energies are derived.  Unfortunately, unlike mana, 
primal energy is only one use, and is generally used for very powerful 
spells, such as 'voodoo' (which uses 5 points) and 'quest' (which uses 
between 1 and 50 points).

~


0 PROTEAN~

This Discipline allows a vampire to transform either their entire body or 
a part of their body into something inhuman.  The vampire can thus grow 
claws, turn into a bat, transform into a wolf or dissolve into a fine 
mist.  A vampire can use most other Disciplines while shapeshifted, but 
may not cast spells.  Full transformation is not possible during combat, 
although claws can be grown if you are fighting.  While shapeshifted the 
vampire cannot wear any equipment.

<<*>> #rUmbravision#n A combination of truesight shadowsight allows
      you to see any hidden charchter accept for monk and ninja.
<<*>> #rFlamehands#n This power erupts your hands into flames.
<<*>> #rEarthmeld#n Allows you to sink into the ground hiding from enemies.
<<*>> #rClaws#n Enables the user to grow inch-long claws on each finger.  These 
      claws have no effect if the vampire is armed, however if not they cause 
      considerably more damage than a normal unarmed attack.
<<*>> #rChange#n Allow the vampire to transform into bat, wolf or mist.  Bat 
      form can fly and detect almost everything (invis, hidden, etc).  While in 
      wolf form, the vampire enjoys the benefit of an extra 500hp and greatly 
      enhanced combat abilities.  Mist form is impervious to attacks and can 
      pass through doors.  Beware though, for two vampires in mist form CAN 
      attack each other.
~

0 CELERITY~

This Discipline explains the legendary superior quickness of vampires.  
Using the Celerity Discipline allows a vampire to move extremely quickly 
and have extra attacks in the same round.
~

0 FORTITUDE~

Fortitude describes a type of supernatural toughness and vigor which
allows Kindred to resist harm.  Many vampires are very tough and are able
to withstand a lot of injury inflicted by weapons and spells.  However 
with the Fortitude power, they resist damage even further by often keeping
the weapons from harming them at all.
~

0 POTENCE~

This Discipline defines the superior strength that vampires often 
possess.  This physical might allows the user to inflict much larger 
amounts of damage in combat than normal.
~

0 OBFUSCATE~

Kindred with this Discipline excel at hiding among and away from crowds.  
When they do not wish to be seen, others rarely notice them even if they 
are standing in plain view.  Though this Discipline affects others minds 
and does not actually render the users invisible, the end result is much 
the same.  Obfuscate is the opposing Discipline to Auspex, and they 
cancel out many of each others powers.

<<*>> #rMask#n Allows you to disguise yourself as another player.
<<*>> #rShield#n Protects you from the Auspex 'scry' and 'readaura' powers.
<<*>> #rMortal#n Switches between vampire and mortal mode.  While in mortal 
      form, you loose all vampire advantages and disadvantages, and are 
      undetectable from a normal mortal.
<<*>> #rVanish#n allows the player to be invisible to the common eye.
<<*>> #rConceal#n This power hides any object it is used on.

<<*>> #rShadowsight#n This power allows you to see in the Umbra.

      at your victim entraping them.

their tongues along weapons, coating them with a deadly snake venom.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere, although there is an experience
penalty for quitting outside of Midgaard.  When you re-enter the game you will
be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.

the Temple of Midgaard.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.

your attributes by spending experience points (exp) at a trainer.

It costs 200 exp to train a stat (str, int, etc), except that it costs 
only 100 exp to train your primary stat.  Primal costs 500 exp for the 
first point, 1000 for the second, 1500 for the third, etc, and 
hp/mana/move cost your current amount in that particular area minus your 
con (for hp and move) or wis (for mana) per point.  Becoming a mortal or 
an avatar costs 1000 exp each.

You can also train weapon resistances (reduces between 1 and all of the 
damage per blow for that weapon type), spell immunities (those types 
of spell do no damage to you), and skill immunities (they no long have

part and cast the spell on the target (they don't have to be in the same 
room).  This will create the voodoo doll, which the caster the voodoo 
commands on to interfere with the victim.
There are three voodoo actions.  The first, 'Stab', is only of use as a 
warning to the victim, or to cause annoyance.  The second, 'Throw', will 
hurl the victim from their feet and cause a small amount of damage.  The 
third and final action, 'Burn', will set the victim on fire, as well as 
destroy the doll itself.
