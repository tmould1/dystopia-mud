This is a copy of the Dystopia MUD codebase that has been updated to compile with the current version of GCC.
And a few other things.
All the original documentation, readme, and licenses are included untouched in the doc folder.

To start the mud, download and cd to the src directory
make sure you have the "build-essential" package installed
run "make clean", then run "make"
after it has compiled, run "./startup &" and it will startup on port 8000
